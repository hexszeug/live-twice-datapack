# Live Twice for Minecraft Java - Datapack Edition

This repository contains the minecraft world with the datapack already installed.
As the datapack does'nt insure the map is fully loaded in other world, you need to use this map.

The map is self explaining, just put it on a Vanilla Minecraft server or open it in LAN to play with friends.
